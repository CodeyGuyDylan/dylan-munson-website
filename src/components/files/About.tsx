         <h2>Personal Life</h2>
         <p>
            I am the husband to an amazing wife and father to an amazing son
            with a daughter on the way. They are my world, and nothing is more
            important to me than them.
         </p>

            I have spent much of my working career working in low-skilled jobs
            such as pizza delivery and warehouse manager. I only (somewhat)
            recently discovered that I wanted to be a full-time programmer.
            After helping one of my friends make a Microsoft PowerApp for his
            department at the College of Southern Idaho, I was in a meeting
            explaining how the app worked to their <abbr>IT</abbr> Apps &amp;
            Data Director. They were short staffed in IT, so he asked me to talk
            with him later about employment opportunities, and he later hired me
            as a Software Support Specialist in <time>January 2020</time>.
         </p>

            My only earlier experience in web development was on a WordPress
            site I had done a couple of years prior, and I did get some C++ and
            JavaScript experience in college. I did not particularly like
            WordPress, so I had written off web design as something I wanted to
            do. After I was hired at <abbr>CSI</abbr>, one of my co-workers
            shared a React tutorial in our team chat and I decided to look at
            it. With my earlier experience with JavaScript, I was able to catch
            on quickly and absolutely loved it.
         </p>

         <p>
            Since then, I have been learning every single day about programming
            in general, but the majority of the learning has been specific to
            web development. A couple of friends and I started a business that
            primarily makes websites and logos where I do all the programming
            and they handle design mockups and the business end of things.

            You will see in the skills file what I have managed to learn, but I
            think the most important part of all this is that I love to learn
            about anything programming. I have a long way to go before I would
            consider myself an expert, but I am very passionate about the craft.
            I often look at my old code and wince (I think all of us have done
            that at some point), which motivates me to make the next project I
            develop as efficient and accessible as possible.
