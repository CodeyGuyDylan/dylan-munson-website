# Welcome to my personal website

The main purpose of this site is for me to use as an online resume. I've always liked the look of matrix style design so I decided to go that direction for this site. Everything you see on my site was done and written by me except for the profile picture who was taken and edited by my good friend Zack Bartlett, he's a wizard with photoshop.

This website is built as a Single Page Application in React. The general stack is as follows

- React
- Styled Components
- TypeScript
- Netlify for hosting
- Formik/Yup for building forms

This is one of the more simple sites I have worked on, unfortunately I cannot make the other sites public on my GitHub as they were made for clients and therefore not able to be public.

I hope you enjoy this site and that my code is up to the standards of any recruiters looking at it, I hope you are having a wonderful day!
